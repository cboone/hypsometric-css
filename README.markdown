# Hypsometric CSS #

By Christopher Boone.

A hodge-podge of stylesheets that I find useful on most projects. Including:

- [reset.css][1]: Resets the styling of all elements to the minimum possible, while keeping a few important details. Does not include elements deprecated in HTML5. Also sets up default block styling for HTML5 elements as appropriate. Based on [Eric Meyer's reset.css][2], [YUI's CSS reset][3], and my personal experience.
- [font-size.css][4]: Outlines basic type sizes and appropriate leading.

Please feel free to use them.
